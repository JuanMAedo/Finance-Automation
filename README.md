# Finance-Automation

The idea is to create a Python script capable of receiving an excel in which we break down our income and expenses and this fills in other excels automatically, in order to control the personal finances of each individual at a detailed level.

In the future the script will create and manipulate ***3 different*** excels with a lot of information about our finances presented in a very visual and dynamic way.

- #### 1.  Annual and Monthly Income and Expenses (20XX)

- #### 2.  Summary of all years of Income and Expenses

- #### 3.  Equity Excel all years

## INPUT: Income and Expenses Template

We will have a table with different columns that will provide us with information for our ways of separating and completing other excels.
These **principal columns** are:

- **Date**: Important for the choice of the correct year and sheet in each excel and in the annual summaries.

- **Description**

- **Amount**

- **Type**: Income or Expense.

- **Category**: With the idea of being multi-response and being able to better break down where each euro of our economy is going.

- **Subcategory**: To be able to know better wher I expend my money.

- **Payment Method**: What bank account, cash, crypto wallet or any Payment Method-
